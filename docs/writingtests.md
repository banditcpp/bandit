# Writing tests

With bandit, you create a command line application that runs all registered
tests, reports the result on stdout, and then returns with exit code `0` if all
tests passed, or exit code greater than `0` if some tests did not pass.

## Entry point

Every application needs an entry point. For bandit it should look like this:

```c++
#include <bandit/bandit.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  return bandit::run(argc, argv);
}
```

The `run()` function will run all registered tests and report the result.

If you build and run this, bandit will report the following:

```bash
$ specs

Could not find any tests.
```

This means bandit is running fine, we just have not added any tests for it to
run yet. No tests failed, so the exit code is `0`.

## Adding tests

Once you have a command line application with an entry point that delegates to
bandit, it is time to start writing some tests.

To make sure everything is working, we begin by creating a failing test. That
way, we know that our tests actually get executed and can verify that they fail
for the right reasons.

We add a new `.cpp` file to our project with the following content:

```c++
#include <bandit/bandit.h>

using namespace snowhouse;
using namespace bandit;

go_bandit([]() {
  describe("our first test", []() {
    it("should fail", [&]() {
      AssertThat(5, Equals(6));
    });
  });
});
```

If we compile and run this, we get the following response:

```bash
$ specs
F
There were failures!

our first test should fail:
/<path to our project>/first.spec.cpp:8: Expected: equal to 6
Actual: 5

Test run complete. 1 tests run. 0 succeeded. 1 failed.
```

This means bandit was able to find our test and execute it.
A non-zero exit code is returned.

## What we did

After including bandit and using its namespace by default, we tell bandit that
this file includes tests that we want to be part of the execution by using the
`go_bandit()` construct.

Inside `go_bandit()` we can now write our tests.

Bandit takes some inspiration from frameworks like [RSpec](https://rspec.info/),
where our tests take the form of specifications that describe how a component
should work.
These specifications can be executed to verify that your code fulfills them.

This is conveyed by the '`describe()`/`it()`' syntax.

`describe()` specifies what we are testing and `it()` specifies what should hold
true for that thing.
Every `it()` must be inside a `describe()`.

A slightly more elaborate example:

```c++
describe("a calculator", []() {
  calculator calc;

  it("can add", [&]() {
    AssertThat(calc.add(2, 3), Equals(5));
  });

  it("can subtract", [&]() {
    AssertThat(calc.subtract(2, 3), Equals(-1));
  });
});
```

Here we describe a calculator and specify that it can add and subtract.

Note that `describe()`s can be nested arbitrarily.
This can be useful to specify particular parts of a class or to specify the
behavior of a class in different contexts. (In contrast to RSpec, bandit
does not provide context logic.)

## Assertions

Bandit uses the [Snowhouse](//github.com/banditcpp/snowhouse#assertions)
assertion framework to verify that things work as expected. Snowhouse contains
a lot of helpers aiming at creating readable tests.
